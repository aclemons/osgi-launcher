# README

This project's goal is to create a simpler, reuseable OSGi launcher. It should
be useable as a standalone runtime or to launch an embedded runtime inside a
WAR file.

The source code for this project was originally forked from the main subproject
of the Apache Felix SVN repository at revision 1740200.

The initial idea came from
[FELIX-3195](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-3195) which has still
not been submitted upstream.

The launcher should be able to start an osgi runtime with felix or equinox.

More details to come.

# README

This project's goal is to create a simpler, reuseable OSGi launcher. It should
be useable as a standalone runtime or to launch an embedded runtime inside a
WAR file.

The source code for this project was originally forked from the main subproject
of the Apache Felix SVN repository at revision 1740200.

More details to come.
